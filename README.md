# Five-Band Audio Equalizer

## Overview
This repository contains project files for a Five-Band Audio Equalizer developed as part of the Laboratory Practice module for semester 3. The project aims to create a graphic equalization circuit with five bands using audio filters.

## Features
- Utilizes audio filters to separate low, high, and mid-range frequencies of the audio stream.
- Incorporates low-pass, high-pass, and band-pass filter circuits.
- Uses operational amplifier-based active filters (op-amps).
- Capable of adding gains in five frequency bands:
  - 20-300Hz
  - 300-1kHz
  - 1kHz-4kHz
  - 4kHz-10kHz
  - 10kHz-20kHz
